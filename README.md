## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Taufiqueshaikh24/credex-task.git>
T
    
    
    
    his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

    ## Getting Started

    First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

    This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
