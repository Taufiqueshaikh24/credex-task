    # Softsell Project

**Softsell** is a web application built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), aimed at providing a smooth and optimized experience for users with automatic font optimization, server-side rendering, and easy deployment. This project uses `create-next-app` to set up the development environment and offers seamless integration with Vercel for deployment.

## Features

### 1. **Next.js Setup**
   - **Bootstrap with `create-next-app`**: A ready-to-go development environment using Next.js.
   - **Development Server**: Run the project with `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or any other supported package manager.
   - **Live Updates**: The page automatically updates as you modify the files, making it easy to test and iterate.

### 2. **Font Optimization**
   - **Geist Font Integration**: We use the Geist font family from Vercel to enhance the aesthetic appeal and readability of the app.
   - **Automatic Font Optimization**: Thanks to Next.js's `next/font` module, the Geist font is loaded efficiently, ensuring improved performance and reducing the risk of FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content).

### 3. **Learning Resources & Documentation**
   - **Next.js Documentation**: Direct links to the Next.js docs are provided to help you understand the features and APIs of Next.js.
   - **Interactive Tutorial**: Get hands-on experience with Next.js through the interactive tutorial available in the documentation.

### 4. **Deployment on Vercel**
   - **Easy Vercel Deployment**: Deploy your application seamlessly to Vercel, making your app ready for production.
   - **Production Optimized**: Vercel's integration with Next.js ensures that your app is optimized for serverless environments and scales efficiently.

## Design Choices

### 1. **Why Next.js?**
   - **File-based Routing**: Next.js uses a file-based routing system that simplifies handling different routes and improves maintainability.
   - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Next.js provides powerful rendering strategies that ensure fast load times and better SEO performance.
   - **Performance Optimization**: Out-of-the-box performance optimizations like image and font handling, automatic static optimization, and code splitting.

### 2. **Geist Font**
   - **Aesthetic Design**: Geist is chosen for its modern and clean design, making the app visually appealing.
   - **Font Optimization**: By using `next/font`, the font is loaded in an optimized way, ensuring fast page loads and improving user experience.

### 3. **Deployment with Vercel**
   - **Why Vercel?**: Vercel integrates effortlessly with Next.js, providing a simple way to deploy applications with minimal configuration and the benefits of serverless functions and automatic scaling.
   - **Seamless Integration**: Vercel ensures that your Next.js app can be deployed with zero configuration and automatic optimization for production environments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Taufiqueshaikh24/credesk.git>
T
    
    
    
    his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

    ## Getting Started

    First, run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

    You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

    This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
